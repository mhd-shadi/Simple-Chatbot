# PROJECT: A SIMPLE CHATBOT: VIRTUAL SHOPPING ASSISTANT FOR "MARVEL COSTUME STORE"
# BY: MHD SHADI HASAN

# NLP ASSIGNMENT NO. 1

# OBJECTIVES:
# 1. A detection of keywords and/or key phrases, with appropriate responses.
# 2. An "intelligent" continuation of the dialogue in case no keyword or key phrase was detected.
# 3. A random generation & selection of answers.
# 4. A "you â€“ I reversal" in the dialogue (e.g. Input: I am happy. Answer: Why are you happy?).
# 5. At least one "intelligent component", such as remembering and referring to what has been said before, (i.e. prior to the directly preceding input).
